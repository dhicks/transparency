  abstract: >-
    The present regulation of carcinogens is quite slow; hundreds of substances
    that have tested positive for carcinogenicity in animal bioassays have not
    been addressed by the U.S. regulatory system. This carries with it
    unappreciated social, economic, and public health costs. However, there are
    readily available expedited approximation procedures for assessing the
    potency of carcinogens whose use has substantial benefits that outweigh any
    costs from less science-intensive and less extensively documented
    assessments. These benefits can be seen by using a model to suggest the
    magnitude of social costs in regulating carcinogens by current conventional
    methods compared with expedited procedures for assessing the potency of
    known carcinogens. Two scenarios, one in accordance with current agency
    presumptions and one which assumes extreme unreliability in animal data and
    in the accuracy of potency assessments, compare conventional
    science-intensive and expedited procedures. On both, the total social costs
    of expedited procedures are lower than conventional procedures across a wide
    range of values assigned for individual mistakes of under regulation and
    over regulation. It appears better to evaluate a larger universe of known
    carcinogens somewhat less intensively for each substance than to evaluate a
    small proportion of that same universe very carefully and delay considering
    the rest.

  abstract: >-
    The role of values in scientific research has become an important topic of
    discussion in both scholarly and popular debates. Pundits across the
    political spectrum worry that research on topics like climate change,
    evolutionary theory, vaccine safety, and genetically modified foods has
    become overly politicized. At the same time, it is clear that values play an
    important role in science by limiting unethical forms of research and by
    deciding what areas of research have the greatest relevance for society.
    Deciding how to distinguish legitimate and illegitimate influences of values
    in scientific research is a matter of vital importance. Recently,
    philosophers of science have written a great deal on this topic, but most of
    their work has been directed toward a scholarly audience. This book makes
    the contemporary philosophical literature on science and values accessible
    to a wide readership. It examines case studies from a variety of research
    areas, including climate science, anthropology, chemical risk assessment,
    ecology, neurobiology, biomedical research, and agriculture. These cases
    show that values have necessary roles to play in identifying research
    topics, choosing research questions, determining the aims of inquiry,
    responding to uncertainty, and deciding how to communicate information.
    Kevin Elliott focuses not just on describing roles for values but also on
    determining when their influences are actually appropriate. He emphasizes
    several conditions for incorporating values in a legitimate fashion, and
    highlights multiple strategies for fostering engagement between stakeholders
    so that value influences can be subjected to careful and critical scrutiny.

  abstract: >-
    Scientists who perform environmental research on policy-relevant topics face
    challenges when communicating about how values may have influenced their
    research. This study examines how citizens view scientists who publicly
    acknowledge values. Specifically, we investigate whether it matters: if
    citizens share or oppose a scientist’s values, if a scientist’s conclusions
    seem contrary to or consistent with the scientist’s values, and if a
    scientist is assessing the state of the science or making a policy
    recommendation. We conducted two 3x2 factorial design online experiments.
    Experiment 1 featured a hypothetical scientist assessing the state of the
    science on the public-health effects of exposure to Bisphenol A (BPA), and
    Experiment 2 featured a scientist making a policy recommendation on use of
    BPA. We manipulated whether or not the scientist expressed values and
    whether the scientist’s conclusion appeared contrary to or consistent with
    the scientist’s values, and we accounted for whether or not subjects’ values
    aligned with the scientist’s values. We analyzed our data with ordinary
    least squares (OLS) regression techniques. Our results provide at least
    preliminary evidence that acknowledging values may reduce the perceived
    credibility of scientists within the general public, but this effect differs
    depending on whether scientists and citizens share values, whether
    scientists draw conclusions that run contrary to their values, and whether
    scientists make policy recommendations.

  abstract: >-
    Background:Over the last several decades, scientists and social groups have
    frequently raised concerns about politicization or political interference in
    regulatory science. Public actors (environmentalists and industry advocates,
    politically aligned public figures, scientists and political commentators,
    in the United States as well as in other countries) across major
    political-regulatory controversies have expressed concerns about the
    inappropriate politicization of science. Although we share concerns about
    the politicization of science, they are frequently framed in terms of an
    ideal of value-free science, according to which political and economic
    values have no legitimate role to play in science. For several decades, work
    in philosophy of science has identified serious conceptual and practical
    problems with the value-free ideal.Objectives:Our objectives are to discuss
    the literature regarding the conceptual and practical problems with the
    value-free ideal and offer a constructive alternative to the value-free
    ideal.Discussion:We first discuss the prevalence of the value-free ideal in
    regulatory science, then argue that this ideal is self-undermining and has
    been exploited to delay protective regulation. To offer a constructive
    alternative, we analyze the relationship between the goals of regulatory
    science and the standards of good scientific activity. This analysis raises
    questions about the relationship between methodological and practical
    standards for good science, tensions among various important social goods,
    and tensions among various social interests. We argue that the aims of
    regulatory science help to legitimize value-laden choices regarding research
    methods and study designs. Finally, we discuss how public deliberation,
    adaptive management, and community-based participatory research can be used
    to improve the legitimacy of scientists as representatives of the general
    public on issues of environmental knowledge.Conclusions:Reflecting on the
    aims of regulatory science—such as protecting human health and the
    environment, informing democratic deliberation, and promoting the capacities
    of environmental justice and Indigenous communities—can clarify when values
    have legitimate roles in regulatory science.

    A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess research
    relevant to understanding consumer and societal attitudes to genetic
    modification applied to agri-food production. The objective was to compare
    attitudes in different global regions, at different times and between
    applications. Seventy articles were included in the final meta-analysis.
    Plant-related or “general” applications were more acceptable than
    animal-related applications. Risk perceptions were greater in Europe than
    North America and Asia. The reverse was true of benefit perceptions. Moral
    concerns are higher in North America and Asia. Both risk and benefit
    perceptions increased with time.

    This study explores time trends in public trust in science in the United
    States from 1974 to 2010. More precisely, I test Mooney’s (2005) claim that
    conservatives in the United States have become increasingly distrustful of
    science. Using data from the 1974 to 2010 General Social Survey, I examine
    group differences in trust in science and group-specific change in these
    attitudes over time. Results show that group differences in trust in science
    are largely stable over the period, except for respondents identifying as
    conservative. Conservatives began the period with the highest trust in
    science, relative to liberals and moderates, and ended the period with the
    lowest. The patterns for science are also unique when compared to public
    trust in other secular institutions. Results show enduring differences in
    trust in science by social class, ethnicity, gender, church attendance, and
    region. I explore the implications of these findings, specifically, the
    potential for political divisions to emerge over the cultural authority of
    science and the social role of experts in the formation of public policy.

  abstract: >-
    The public has voiced concern over the adverse effects of vaccines from the
    moment Dr. Edward Jenner introduced the first smallpox vaccine in 1796. The
    controversy over childhood immunization intensified in 1998, when Dr. Andrew
    Wakefield linked the MMR vaccine to autism. Although Wakefield’s findings
    were later discredited and retracted, and medical and scientific evidence
    suggests routine immunizations have significantly reduced life-threatening
    conditions like measles, whooping cough, and polio, vaccine refusal and
    vaccine-preventable outbreaks are on the rise. This book explores vaccine
    hesitancy and refusal among parents in the industrialized North. Although
    biomedical, public health, and popular science literature has focused on a
    scientifically ignorant public, the real problem, Maya J. Goldenberg argues,
    lies not in misunderstanding, but in mistrust. Public confidence in
    scientific institutions and government bodies has been shaken by fraud,
    research scandals, and misconduct. Her book reveals how vaccine studies
    sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry, compelling rhetorics from the
    anti-vaccine movement, and the spread of populist knowledge on social media
    have all contributed to a public mistrust of the scientific consensus.
    Importantly, it also emphasizes how historical and current discrimination in
    health care against marginalized communities continues to shape public
    perception of institutional trustworthiness. Goldenberg ultimately reframes
    vaccine hesitancy as a crisis of public trust rather than a war on science,
    arguing that having good scientific support of vaccine efficacy and safety
    is not enough. In a fraught communications landscape, Vaccine Hesitancy
    advocates for trust-building measures that focus on relationships,
    transparency, and justice.

  abstract: >-
    Given their lack of background knowledge, laypeople require expert help when
    dealing with scientific information. To decide whose help is dependable,
    laypeople must judge an expert’s epistemic trustworthiness in terms of
    competence, adherence to scientific standards, and good intentions. Online,
    this may be difficult due to the often limited and sometimes unreliable
    source information available. To measure laypeople’s evaluations of experts
    (encountered online), we constructed an inventory to assess epistemic
    trustworthiness on the dimensions expertise, integrity, and benevolence.
    Exploratory (n = 237) and confirmatory factor analyses (n = 345) showed that
    the Muenster Epistemic Trustworthiness Inventory (METI) is composed of these
    three factors. A subsequent experimental study (n = 137) showed that all
    three dimensions of the METI are sensitive to variation in source
    characteristics. We propose using this inventory to measure assignments of
    epistemic trustworthiness, that is, all judgments laypeople make when
    deciding whether to place epistemic trust in–and defer to–an expert in order
    to solve a scientific informational problem that is beyond their
    understanding.

  abstract: >-
    <p>Since at least the mid-2000s, political commentators, environmental
    advocates, and scientists have raised concerns about an “anti-science”
    approach to environmental policymaking in conservative governments in the US
    and Canada. This paper explores and resolves a paradox surrounding at least
    some uses of the “anti-science” epithet. I examine two cases of such
    “anti-science” environmental policy, both of which involve appeals to
    epistemic values that are widely endorsed by both scientists and
    philosophers of science. It seems paradoxical to call an appeal to epistemic
    values “anti-science.” I develop an analysis that, I argue, can resolve this
    paradox. This analysis is a version of the “aims approach” to science and
    values, drawing on ideas from axiology and virtue ethics. I characterize the
    paradox in terms of conflicts or tensions between epistemic and pragmatic
    aims, and argue that there is a key asymmetry between them: epistemic aims
    are valuable, in part, because they are useful for pursuing pragmatic aims.
    Thus, when epistemic and pragmatic aims conflict, epistemic aims need to be
    reconceptualized in order to reconcile them to pragmatic aims. When this is
    done, in the “anti-science” cases, the epistemic values are scientific vices
    rather than virtues. Thus the “anti-science” epithet is apt.</p>

    Addressing climate change in the United States requires enactment of
    national, state and local mitigation and adaptation policies. The success of
    these initiatives depends on public opinion, policy support and behaviours
    at appropriate scales. Public opinion, however, is typically measured with
    national surveys that obscure geographic variability across regions, states
    and localities. Here we present independently validated high-resolution
    opinion estimates using a multilevel regression and poststratification
    model. The model accurately predicts climate change beliefs, risk
    perceptions and policy preferences at the state, congressional district,
    metropolitan and county levels, using a concise set of demographic and
    geographic predictors. The analysis finds substantial variation in public
    opinion across the nation. Nationally, 63% of Americans believe global
    warming is happening, but county-level estimates range from 43 to 80%,
    leading to a diversity of political environments for climate policy. These
    estimates provide an important new source of information for policymakers,
    educators and scientists to more effectively address the challenges of
    climate change.

  abstract: >-
    While it is widely acknowledged that science is not “free” of non-epistemic
    values, there is disagreement about the roles that values can appropriately
    play. Several have argued that non-epistemic values can play important roles
    in modeling decisions, particularly in addressing uncertainties (Moss and
    Schneider 2000; Kandlikar et al. (C.R. Geoscience 337:443-455, 2005); Risbey
    2007; Biddle and Winsberg 2010; Winsberg (Kennedy Institute of Ethics
    Journal 22(2): 111-137, 2012); van der Sluijs (Climatic Change 75 (3)
    359-389, 2012). On the other hand, such values can (even unconsciously) lead
    to bias (Pielke 2007; Oppenhiemer et al. (Science 317:1505-1506, 2007); Bray
    (Environmental Science & Policy 13:340-350, 2010); Oreskes and Conway 2010).
    Thus, it is important to identify when it is legitimate to appeal to
    non-epistemic values in modeling decisions. An approach is defended here
    whereby such value judgments are legitimate when they promote democratically
    endorsed epistemological and social aims of research. This framework
    accounts for why it is legitimate to appeal to non-epistemic values in a
    range of modeling decisions, while addressing concerns that the presence of
    such values will lead to bias or give scientists disproportionate power in
    deciding what values ought to be endorsed.

  abstract: >-
    The 2016 presidential election was a jarring event for polling in the United
    States. Preelection polls fueled high-profile predictions that Hillary
    Clinton’s likelihood of winning the presidency was about 90 percent, with
    estimates ranging from 71 to over 99 percent. When Donald Trump was declared
    the winner of the presidency, there was a widespread perception that the
    polls failed. But did the polls fail? And if so, why? Those are among the
    central questions addressed by an American Association for Public Opinion
    Research (AAPOR) ad hoc committee. This paper presents the committee’s
    analysis of the performance of preelection polls in 2016, how that
    performance compares to polling in prior elections, and the extent to which
    performance varied by poll design. In addition, the committee examined
    several theories as to why many polls, particularly in the Upper Midwest,
    underestimated support for Trump. The explanations for which the most
    evidence exists are a late swing in vote preference toward Trump and a
    pervasive failure to adjust for overrepresentation of college graduates (who
    favored Clinton). In addition, there is clear evidence that voter turnout
    changed from 2012 to 2016 in ways that favored Trump, though there is only
    mixed evidence that misspecified likely voter models were a major cause of
    the systematic polling error. Finally, there is little evidence that
    socially desirable (Shy Trump) responding was an important contributor to
    poll error.

  abstract: >-
    Social scientists have offered a number of explanations for why Americans
    commonly deny that human-caused climate change is real. In this paper, I
    argue that these explanations neglect an important group of climate change
    deniers: those who say they are on the side of science while also rejecting
    what they know most climate scientists accept. I then develop a “nature of
    science” hypothesis that does account for this group of deniers. According
    to this hypothesis, people have serious misconceptions about what scientific
    inquiry ought to look like. Their misconceptions interact with partisan
    biases to produce denial of human-caused climate change. After I develop
    this hypothesis, I propose ways of confirming that it is true. Then I
    consider its implications for efforts to combat climate change denial and
    for other cases of public rejection of science.

    Research has documented the decline of trust in science among Republicans,
    ideological conservatives, and fundamentalist religious groups. However,
    less is known about the nature of party polarization in these trends: did
    polarization only increase because of changes among Republicans? In this
    study, the author tests a two-sided polarization thesis using data from the
    General Social Survey (1974–2018). The findings show that a significant
    share of the growth in party polarization is due to an increase of trust in
    science among Democrats. In fact, by the 2010s, Democrats became
    significantly more likely than either Republicans or independents to have
    high confidence in science. Moreover, the results also show that the
    aggregate party-level changes are driven largely by trends among
    conservative Republicans, moderate Democrats, and liberal Democrats.
    Together, these findings have implications for our understanding of the
    nature and potential causes of partisan polarization in beliefs about the
    cultural authority of science.

  abstract: >-
    When communicating scientific information, experts often face difficult
    choices about how to promote public understanding while also maintaining an
    appropriate level of objectivity. We argue that one way for scientists and
    others involved in communicating scientific information to alleviate these
    tensions is to pay closer attention to the major frames employed in the
    contexts in which they work. By doing so, they can ideally employ useful
    frames while also enabling the recipients of information to “backtrack” to
    relatively uncontroversial facts and recognize how these frames relate to
    their own values and perspectives. Important strategies for promoting this
    sort of backtracking include identifying the weaknesses of particular
    frames, preventing misunderstanding of them, differentiating well-supported
    findings from more speculative claims, and acknowledging major alternative
    frames.

  abstract: >-
    While climate scientists have developed high resolution data sets on the
    distribution of climate risks, we still lack comparable data on the local
    distribution of public climate change opinions. This paper provides the
    first effort to estimate local climate and energy opinion variability
    outside the United States. Using a multi-level regression and
    post-stratification (MRP) approach, we estimate opinion in federal electoral
    districts and provinces. We demonstrate that a majority of the Canadian
    public consistently believes that climate change is happening. Belief in
    climate change’s causes varies geographically, with more people attributing
    it to human activity in urban as opposed to rural areas. Most prominently,
    we find majority support for carbon cap and trade policy in every province
    and district. By contrast, support for carbon taxation is more
    heterogeneous. Compared to the distribution of US climate opinions,
    Canadians believe climate change is happening at higher levels. This new
    opinion data set will support climate policy analysis and climate policy
    decision making at national, provincial and local levels.

  abstract: >-
    Even as US partisan polarization shapes climate and energy attitudes,
    substantial heterogeneity in climate opinions still exists among both
    Republicans and Democrats. To date, our understanding of this partisan
    heterogeneity has been limited to analysis of national- or, less commonly,
    state-level opinion poll subsamples. However, the dynamics of political
    representation and issue commitments play out over more finely resolved
    state and local scales. Here we use previously validated multilevel
    regression and post-stratification (MRP) models (Howe et al., Nat Clim Chang
    5(6):596–603 2015; Mildenberger et al., PLoS One 11(8):e0159774 2016)
    combined with a novel approach to measuring the distribution of party
    members to model, for the first time, the spatial distribution of partisan
    climate and energy opinions. We find substantial geographic variation in
    Republican climate opinions across states and congressional districts. While
    Democratic party members consistently think human-caused global warming is
    happening and support climate policy reforms, the intensity of their climate
    beliefs also varies spatially at state and local scales. These results have
    policy-relevant implications for the trajectory of US climate policy
    reforms.

  abstract: >-
    The research reported here aims to understand how people react to statements
    expressing risk uncertainty information in the context of a commonly
    experienced potential hazard, food related risks. Public perception of
    seriousness of risk for themselves, and for other people was examined for
    different types of uncertainty, for each of five different food hazards. The
    results indicated that participants responded to the different types of
    uncertainty in a uniform way, suggesting that perception of risk associated
    with uncertainty is not affected by the 'type' of uncertainty. The results
    further indicated that the seriousness of risk, in the presence of
    statements of uncertainty, was perceived to be greater for pesticides and
    genetic modification compared to BSE, high fat diets and Salmonella . It was
    argued that this could be due to the perceptions of low personal control,
    and high societal responsibility to protect people and societal control over
    exposure to the potential risks of pesticides and genetic modification.
    Under circumstances where people feel they have little personal control over
    their exposure to a particular hazard, and those social institutions that
    are perceived to be in control of protecting the public indicate that there
    is uncertainty associated with risk estimates, the hazard may appear to be
    'out of control', which is associated with a perception of serious risk.

    The U.S. scientific community has long led the world in research on such
    areas as public health, environmental science, and issues affecting quality
    of life. These scientists have produced landmark studies on the dangers of
    DDT, tobacco smoke, acid rain, and global warming. But at the same time, a
    small yet potent subset of this community leads the world in vehement denial
    of these dangers.Merchants of Doubt tells the story of how a loose-knit
    group of high-level scientists and scientific advisers, with deep
    connections in politics and industry, ran effective campaigns to mislead the
    public and deny well-established scientific knowledge over four decades.
    Remarkably, the same individuals surface repeatedly-some of the same figures
    who have claimed that the science of global warming is "not settled" denied
    the truth of studies linking smoking to lung cancer, coal smoke to acid
    rain, and CFCs to the ozone hole. "Doubt is our product," wrote one tobacco
    executive. These "experts" supplied it. Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway,
    historians of science, roll back the rug on this dark corner of the American
    scientific community, showing how ideology and corporate interests, aided by
    a too-compliant media, have skewed public understanding of some of the most
    pressing issues of our era.

    We examine key aspects of data quality for online behavioral research
    between selected platforms (Amazon Mechanical Turk, CloudResearch, and
    Prolific) and panels (Qualtrics and Dynata). To identify the key aspects of
    data quality, we first engaged with the behavioral research community to
    discover which aspects are most critical to researchers and found that these
    include attention, comprehension, honesty, and reliability. We then explored
    differences in these data quality aspects in two studies (N ~ 4000), with or
    without data quality filters (approval ratings). We found considerable
    differences between the sites, especially in comprehension, attention, and
    dishonesty. In Study 1 (without filters), we found that only Prolific
    provided high data quality on all measures. In Study 2 (with filters), we
    found high data quality among CloudResearch and Prolific. MTurk showed
    alarmingly low data quality even with data quality filters. We also found
    that while reputation (approval rating) did not predict data quality,
    frequency and purpose of usage did, especially on MTurk: the lowest data
    quality came from MTurk participants who report using the site as their main
    source of income but spend few hours on it per week. We provide a framework
    for future investigation into the ever-changing nature of data quality in
    online research, and how the evolving set of platforms and panels performs
    on these key aspects.

  abstract: >-
    Science is the study of our world, as it is in its messy reality.
    Nonetheless, science requires idealization to function—if we are to attempt
    to understand the world, we have to find ways to reduce its complexity. 
    Idealization and the Aims of Science shows just how crucial idealization is
    to science and why it matters. Beginning with the acknowledgment of our
    status as limited human agents trying to make sense of an exceedingly
    complex world, Angela Potochnik moves on to explain how science aims to
    depict and make use of causal patterns—a project that makes essential use of
    idealization. She offers case studies from a number of branches of science
    to demonstrate the ubiquity of idealization, shows how causal patterns are
    used to develop scientific explanations, and describes how the necessarily
    imperfect connection between science and truth leads to researchers’ values
    influencing their findings. The resulting book is a tour de force, a
    synthesis of the study of idealization that also offers countless new
    insights and avenues for future exploration.

    While scholarly attention to date has focused almost entirely on
    individual-level drivers of vaccine confidence, we show that macro-level
    factors play an important role in understanding individual propensity to be
    confident about vaccination. We analyse data from the 2018 Wellcome Global
    Monitor survey covering over 120,000 respondents in 126 countries to assess
    how societal-level trust in science is related to vaccine confidence. In
    countries with a high aggregate level of trust in science, people are more
    likely to be confident about vaccination, over and above their
    individual-level scientific trust. Additionally, we show that societal
    consensus around trust in science moderates these individual-level and
    country-level relationships. In countries with a high level of consensus
    regarding the trustworthiness of science and scientists, the positive
    correlation between trust in science and vaccine confidence is stronger than
    it is in comparable countries where the level of social consensus is weaker.

  abstract: >-
    This paper assesses whether ExxonMobil Corporation has in the past misled
    the general public about climate change. We present an empirical
    document-by-document textual content analysis and comparison of 187 climate
    change communications from ExxonMobil, including peer-reviewed and
    non-peer-reviewed publications, internal company documents, and paid,
    editorial-style advertisements (‘advertorials’) in The New York Times . We
    examine whether these communications sent consistent messages about the
    state of climate science and its implications—specifically, we compare their
    positions on climate change as real, human-caused, serious, and solvable. In
    all four cases, we find that as documents become more publicly accessible,
    they increasingly communicate doubt. This discrepancy is most pronounced
    between advertorials and all other documents. For example, accounting for
    expressions of reasonable doubt, 83% of peer-reviewed papers and 80% of
    internal documents acknowledge that climate change is real and human-caused,
    yet only 12% of advertorials do so, with 81% instead expressing doubt. We
    conclude that ExxonMobil contributed to advancing climate science—by way of
    its scientists’ academic publications—but promoted doubt about it in
    advertorials. Given this discrepancy, we conclude that ExxonMobil misled the
    public. Our content analysis also examines ExxonMobil’s discussion of the
    risks of stranded fossil fuel assets. We find the topic discussed and
    sometimes quantified in 24 documents of various types, but absent from
    advertorials. Finally, based on the available documents, we outline
    ExxonMobil’s strategic approach to climate change research and
    communication, which helps to contextualize our findings.

    We are all just a little bit plastic. Traces of bisphenol A or BPA, a
    chemical used in plastics production, are widely detected in our bodies and
    environment. Is this chemical, and its presence in the human body, safe?
    What is meant by safety? Who defines it, and according to what information?
    Is It Safe? narrates how the meaning of the safety of industrial chemicals
    has been historically produced by breakthroughs in environmental health
    research, which in turn trigger contests among trade associations, lawyers,
    politicians, and citizen activists to set new regulatory standards. Drawing
    on archival research and extensive interviews, author Sarah Vogel explores
    the roots of the contemporary debate over the safety of BPA, and the
    concerns presented by its estrogen-like effects even at low doses.
    Ultimately, she contends that science alone cannot resolve the political and
    economic conflicts at play in the definition of safety. To strike a
    sustainable balance between the interests of commerce and public health
    requires recognition that powerful interests will always try to shape the
    criteria for defining safety, and that the agenda for environmental health
    research should be protected from capture by any single interest group.

    Existing cross-sectional studies indicated a positive association of
    bisphenol A (BPA) with overweight and obesity. However, the relationship and
    potential mechanisms underlying this association remain to be elucidated in
    prospective studies.

    This study was designed to investigate whether serum BPA is associated with
    incident overweight and obesity risk, and to further explore whether
    adiponectin plays a mediating role in the association.

    We measured blood BPA and adiponectin in Chinese populations. The
    association of serum BPA with overweight and obesity risk was evaluated
    using multivariable logistic regression models. We further examined the
    mediating effect of adiponectin by causal mediation analysis.

    Among 796 participants free of overweight and obesity at baseline, 133
    individuals developed overweight and obesity during the follow-up period.
    Compared with those in the lowest quartile of serum BPA, those in the second
    and third quartiles were positively associated with incident overweight and
    obesity risk adjusting for covariates (all P-values < 0.05), whereas this
    association was not observed in the fourth quartile. Further spline analysis
    showed an inverted U-shaped dose-response relationship (Pnon-linear = 0.04).
    Furthermore, each unit of serum log10-transformed BPA levels was associated
    with higher changes in waist-to-height ratio and body roundness index (all
    P-values < 0.05). Mediation analysis indicated significant indirect effects
    of adiponectin on the associations of BPA with overweight and obesity
    prevalence (mediation proportion: 46.08%; P = 0.02), and BMI levels
    (mediation proportion: 30.32%; P = 0.03).

    Serum BPA displayed a positive association with incident overweight and
    obesity risk in a non-monotonic pattern, and adiponectin might mediate the
    association. Further mechanistic studies are warranted.

    Human exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) is mainly due to migration from plastic
    packaging into food and beverages. Studies reported BPA endocrine
    disruptions through interactions with different nuclear receptors, including
    the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR). AhR mediates xenobiotic responses and
    regulates expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs), including many
    CYP450s. This study aimed to assess the effects of BPA maternal exposure on
    CYP450s expression in fetal brain. Sprague-Dawley dams were exposed to BPA
    concentrations of 0, 0.5, 5, and 50 mg/L in drinking water, individually,
    and with nicotine. Fetal brains were isolated at gestational days GD14 and
    GD19, and protein expression was assessed by Western blotting. Results
    showed a BPA-induced significant decrease in CYP1B1 expression levels at
    GD14 (p = 0.001), and CYP19A1 (aromatase) expression at both mid- and
    late-stage development (p < 0.001). In addition, nicotine individually
    decreased expression levels of all examined protein targets, significantly
    for CYP1B1 (p < 0.001), CYP19A1 (p = 0.010), AhRR (p = 0.042), and ARNT (p <
    0.001), compared to control. When combined with BPA, nicotine suppressive
    effects were attenuated at both GD14 and GD19. In conclusion, BPA suppresses
    CYP1B1 and CYP19A1 expression in fetal brain, and attenuates the suppressive
    effects of nicotine. Observed effects may be mediated by AhR-ARNT
    independent mechanisms that need further examination.

    Bisphenol analogues (BPs) are widely used in plastics, food packaging and
    other commercial products as non safer alternative of BPA. As emerging
    environmental contaminants, BPs have received considerable attention for
    their adverse effects on human health. However, their effects on liver
    metabolisms are only marginally understood. In this study, high-resolution
    mass spectrometry-based global metabolomics and extracellular flux (XF)
    analysis were applied to characterize the cellular metabolome alterations
    and reveal the possible mechanisms of the metabolic disorders associated
    with BPs-induced toxicity in HepG2 cells. BPE, BPB and BPAP with similar
    chemical structures were selected to compare their interference with
    different metabolic pathways. A total of 61 key metabolite profiles were
    significantly altered after exposure to the three BPs. Overall, BPs altered
    metabolites which are associated with energy metabolism, oxidative stress,
    cell proliferation and nucleotides synthesis. The primary dysregulated
    pathways included energy and nucleotides synthesis related Purine and
    Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis metabolism. In addition, attenuated mitochondrial
    function and enhanced glycolysis were found under BPB and BPAP treatment.
    While attenuated glycolysis was observed under BPE treatment. These findings
    may provide potential biomarkers indicating the cytotoxicity of BPs and
    prompt a deeper understanding of the intramolecular metabolic processes
    induced by BPs exposure.

    Testicular junctions are pivotal to male fertility and regulated by
    constituent proteins. Increasing evidence suggests that environmental
    chemicals, including bisphenol A (BPA), may impact these proteins, but
    whether the impacts persist for generations is not yet known. Here, we
    investigate the effect of BPA (a ubiquitous endocrine-disrupting chemical)
    on testis and sperm functions and whether the effects are transferred to
    subsequent generations. Male mice (F0) were exposed to corn oil (Control) or
    5 or 50 mg BPA/kg body weight/day from 6 to 12 weeks of age. The F0 were
    mated with wild-type females to produce the first filial (F1) generation. F2
    and F3 were produced using similar procedures. Our results showed that BPA
    doses decreased the levels of some junctional proteins partly via binding
    with estrogen receptors (ERα and Erβ), upregulation of p-ERK1/2, P85, p-JNK
    and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling.
    Consequently, testicular histological abnormalities, disrupted
    spermatogenesis, decreased sperm count, and inability to fertilize eggs were
    observed in mice exposed to BPA. These effects were transferred to
    successive generations (F2), partly through DNA methylation, but mostly
    alleviated in F3 males. Our findings suggest that paternal exposure to
    chemicals promoting alteration of testicular junctional proteins and its
    transgenerational inheritance is a key component of the origin of male
    reproductive health problems.

    The present study was aimed to investigate the association of Bisphenol-A
    (BPA) and MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism with the risk of breast cancer in Indian
    women.

    Blood samples from breast cancer patients and healthy controls were analyzed
    by using UV visible spectrophotometry for structural changes in blood
    components by BPAQ. MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism was investigated by using TETRA
    ARMS-PCR.

    On comparing control groups, there is an increased mean absorbance at a
    range of 250 nm to 300 nm and 360 nm to 450 nm in breast cancer patients.
    The allele frequencies of case subjects (T, 0.47; G, 0.53) were
    significantly different from those of control subjects (T, 0.66; G, 0.34) (p
    = 0.011). The proportion of GG genotype of the SNP309 in breast cancer
    patients (28.88%) was significantly higher than that of control groups
    (13.33%). With TT genotype as reference, the genotypes (TG + GG) containing
    G allele as dominant form in breast cancer patients (OR, 2.80; 95% CI,
    1.12–7.00); p = 0.025) were significantly associated with breast cancer.

    The results revealed that there is an association between active metabolite
    of Bisphenol-A and MDM2 SNP309 G variant with the risk of breast cancer in
    Indian population.

    Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a persistent environmental pollutant and
    will continually accumulate in blood due to its chemical inertness and
    strong interaction with serum proteins, especially serum albumin (SA),
    inducing highly adverse health risks. However, the molecular mechanisms of
    dynamic interactions between PFOA with serum proteins remain unclear,
    limiting the development of potential therapeutic strategies. Herein, we
    developed an integrated structural strategy to systematically profile the
    molecular details of dynamic interactions among PFOA, SA, and β-cyclodextrin
    (β-CD) by combing native mass spectrometry (nMS), lysine reactivity
    profiling (LRP), and molecular docking (MD) simulation. The SA site 1, site
    2 pockets, and cleft nearby are observed as the primary interaction regions
    of PFOA. Further, β-CD can disrupt the PFOA combinations with bovine SA
    regions around sites Lys20, Lys280, Lys350, and Lys431–Lys439, with an
    overall reversing efficiency of about 26% at an identical concentration to
    PFOA. The interactome of PFOA with complex human serum proteins is globally
    profiled with molecular interaction details, including human serum albumin,
    apolipoprotein A-I, alpha-2-macroglobulin, and complement C3. Our results
    reveal molecular insights into the detail of the interaction between PFOA
    and serum proteins, beneficial to understanding PFOA toxicology.

    Bisphenol A (BPA), an environmental endocrine disruptor, has attracted
    increasing attention to its adverse effects on brain developmental process.
    The previous study indicated that BPA rapidly increased motility and density
    of dendritic filopodia and enhanced the phosphorylation of
    N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NR2B in cultured hippocampal
    neurons within 30 min. The purpose of the present study was further to
    investigate the effects of BPA for 24 h on dendritic morphogenesis and the
    underlying mechanisms. After cultured for 5 d in vitro, the hippocampal
    neurons from 24 h-old rat were infected by AdV-EGFP to indicate time-lapse
    imaging of living neurons. The results demonstrated that the exposure of the
    cultured hippocampal neurons to BPA (10, 100 nM) or 17β-estradiol (17β-E2,
    10 nM) for 24 h significantly promoted dendritic development, as evidenced
    by the increased total length of dendrite and the enhanced motility and
    density of dendritic filopodia. However, these changes were suppressed by an
    ERs antagonist, ICI182,780, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist,
    MK-801, and a mitogen-activated ERK1/2-activating kinase (MEK1/2) inhibitor,
    U0126. Meanwhile, the increased F-actin (filamentous actin) induced by BPA
    (100 nM) was also completely eliminated by these blockers. Furthermore, the
    result of western blot analyses showed that, the exposure of the cultures to
    BPA or 17β-E2 for 24 h promoted the expression of Rac1/Cdc42 but inhibited
    that of RhoA, suggesting Rac1 (Ras related C3 botulinum toxinsubstrate
    1)/Cdc42 (cell divisioncycle 42) and RhoA (Ras homologous A), the Rho family
    of small GTPases, were involved in BPA- or 17β-E2-induced changes in the
    dendritic morphogenesis of neurons. These BPA- or 17β-E2-induced effects
    were completely blocked by ICI182,780, and were partially suppressed by
    U0126. These results reveal that, similar to 17β-E2, BPA exerts its effects
    on dendritic morphogenesis by eliciting both nuclear actions and
    extranuclear-initiated actions that are integrated to influence the
    development of dendrite in hippocampal neurons.

    The hypothalamus plays key roles in regulating reproduction and energy
    balance. We determined the transcriptional profile of the hypothalamus (F0
    and F1) to identify its relationship with the reproductive function and
    metabolic phenotypes of rats under BPA exposure and the paternal
    contribution. Male rats received 35 μg/kg bw/day BPA, 5 μg/kg bw/day
    ethinylestradiol (EE2) or vehicle via diet. At PND 170, the sexual behaviour
    of male F0 rats was assessed before mating. The metabolic and reproductive
    phenotypes and the transcriptional profiles of the testis (F0) and
    hypothalamus were tested in F0 and F1 rats. Male rats exposed to BPA
    exhibited no changes in fertility, metabolic phenotypes, sperm quality or
    serum sex hormones, but none of them ejaculated during the test period. Four
    differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the F0 hypothalamus and 51 DEGs in
    the F0 testis were identified in the BPA group. Paternal BPA and EE2
    exposure increased the body weight and food intake of male offspring, and
    164 and 3433 DEGs were identified in the hypothalamus of BPA- and
    EE2-treated rats (F1, male), respectively. The highest-ranked function
    impaired by BPA and EE2 in the F1 hypothalamus was immune function. BPA and
    EE2 exposure induced alterations in the metabolic phenotype in F1-generation
    males, and this effect may be related to the altered inflammatory-related
    signalling pathways in the hypothalamus but neither treatment affected the
    F0 hypothalamus. Hundreds of genes in the F1 hypothalamus showed changes
    upon BPA and EE2 treatment. Concern regarding paternal environmental
    endocrine disruptor exposure should be raised.

    We assessed the long-term effect of perinatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA)
    on the rat uterus and the uterine response to estrogen (E2) replacement
    therapy. BPA (0.5 or 50 μg/kg/day) was administered in the drinking water
    from gestational day 9 until weaning. We studied the uterus of female
    offspring on postnatal day (PND) 90 and 360, and the uterine E2 response on
    PND460 (PND460-E2). On PND90, BPA-exposed rats showed altered glandular
    proliferation and α-actin expression. On PND360, BPA exposure increased the
    incidence of abnormalities in the luminal and glandular epithelium. On
    PND460-E2, the multiplicity of glands with squamous metaplasia increased in
    BPA50 while the incidence of glands with daughter glands increased in
    BPA0.5. The expression of steroid receptors, p63 and IGF-I was modified in
    BPA-exposed rats on PND460-E2. The long-lasting effects of perinatal
    exposure to BPA included induction of abnormalities in uterine tissue and
    altered response to E2 replacement therapy.

    As part of the 7th International Workshops on Genotoxicity Testing held in
    Tokyo, Japan in November 2017, a workgroup of experts reviewed and assessed
    the risk of aneugens for human health. The present manuscript is one of
    three manuscripts from the workgroup and reports on the unanimous consensus
    reached on the evidence for aneugens affecting germ cells, their mechanisms
    of action and role in hereditary diseases. There are 24 chemicals with
    strong or sufficient evidence for germ cell aneugenicity providing robust
    support for the ability of chemicals to induce germ cell aneuploidy.
    Interference with microtubule dynamics or inhibition of topoisomerase II
    function are clear characteristics of germ cell aneugens. Although there are
    mechanisms of chromosome segregation that are unique to germ cells, there is
    currently no evidence for germ cell-specific aneugens. However, the
    available data are heavily skewed toward chemicals that are aneugenic in
    somatic cells. Development of high-throughput screening assays in suitable
    animal models for exploring additional targets for aneuploidy induction,
    such as meiosis-specific proteins, and to prioritize chemicals for the
    potential to be germ cell aneugens is encouraged. Evidence in animal models
    support that: oocytes are more sensitive than spermatocytes and somatic
    cells to aneugens; exposure to aneugens leads to aneuploid conceptuses; and,
    the frequencies of aneuploidy are similar in germ cells and zygotes.
    Although aneuploidy in germ cells is a significant cause of infertility and
    pregnancy loss in humans, there is currently limited evidence that aneugens
    induce hereditary diseases in human populations because the great majority
    of aneuploid conceptuses die in utero. Overall, the present work underscores
    the importance of protecting the human population from exposure to chemicals
    that can induce aneuploidy in germ cells that, in contrast to
    carcinogenicity, is directly linked to an adverse outcome.

    Bisphenol A is a known endocrine disrupting chemical and reproductive
    toxicant. Previous studies indicate that in utero BPA exposure increases the
    percentage of germ cells in nests and decreases the percentage of primordial
    follicles. However, the mechanism by which BPA affects germ cell nest
    breakdown is unknown. Thus, we hypothesized that BPA inhibits germ cell nest
    breakdown by interfering with oxidative stress and apoptosis pathways. To
    test our hypothesis, ovaries from newborn mice were collected and cultured
    with vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) or different doses of BPA (0.1, 1,
    5, and 10 μg/mL). Ovaries then were subjected to histological evaluation of
    germ cell nests and primordial follicles or to measurements of factors that
    regulate oxidative stress and apoptosis. Our results indicate that in vitro
    BPA exposure significantly inhibits germ cell nest breakdown by altering the
    expression of key ovarian apoptotic genes, but not by interfering with the
    oxidative stress pathway.

    Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have become of concern for a variety f
    health issues. Due to their effects on the endocrine system they have been
    thoroughly examined with regards to sexual dysfunction, malformation, and
    cancers of reproductive origin. Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a widely studied EDC
    and has been characterized regarding its estrogenic effects on a variety of
    cell types. BPA also alters immune responses. In this review, we examine
    some of the documented effects of EDCs, with a focus on BPA that pertain to
    modulation of the immune system and various immune cell populations. We
    highlight the multiple actions of BPA on altering T cell subsets, B cell
    functions, and dendritic cell and macrophage biology. Finally, we consider
    that these immunological activities of BPA may be mediated through estrogen
    receptor signaling, arylhydrocarbon receptor, and the peroxisome
    proliferator-activated receptor family of nuclear receptors.
