# Introduction #

# Methods and Materials #

# Results #

We tested the hypothesis of a modest correlation between values and ideology in two ways. First, to test (H1a) whether political liberals are more likely to prioritize public health over economic growth compared to conservatives, we conducted a Spearman's rank order correlation. Results revealed a significant correlation in line with the hypothesis, Spearman's rho = -.47, p < .001. Political liberals were more likely than conservatives to value public health over economic growth. To test (H1b) that a majority of political conservatives priortize public health over economic growth we cross-tabulated the data. Results revealed that, contrary to the hypothesis, slightly more than half of the self-reported political conservatives in our sample reported valuing economic growth (51.7%) over public health (48.3%).

Next, we tested the hypotheses that (H2) scientists who find a chemical harms human health are perceived as more trustworthy than scientist who find that a chemical does not cause harm and (H3) a scientist who discloses values are perceived as less trustworthy than a scientist who does not. For this analysis, we regressed participants' METI ratings onto both the Conclusions and Disclosure experimental conditions. The full model was significant, adj. R^2 = .148, F(2, 985) = 86.59, p < .001 (see Table #). Specifically, results revealed that the conclusions reported by the scientist predicted participants' perceived trustworthiness in line with our hypothesis. Participants rated the scientist who reported that BPA causes harm as more trustworthy than the scientist who reported that BPA does not cause harm. By contrast, the results do not provide evidence in favor of our hypothesis that a scientist disclosing their values are perceived as less trustworthy than a scientist who does not disclose values. 

Next, we tested the hypothesis that (H4) if the participant and scientist share the same values, the scientist is perceived as more trustworthy than if the participant and scientist do not share the same values. For this and related analyses, we only included data from participants who were assigned to either of the Disclosure conditions and self-reported their own values, reducing the sample to 567. Following this, we created a new Shared Values variable as a composite of the participants' reported values and the scientist's values. For this analysis, because the Shared Values is a composite, we wanted to adjust the model to account for any direct contributions to participants' METI rating by either the scientist's values or the participants' values. Thus, we regression participant METI scores onto the participants' reported values, the scientist's values condition, and the composite Shared Values variable. The resulting model was significant, adj. R^2 = .065, F(3, 563) = 14.15, p < .001. However, contrary to expectations, Shared Values did not emerge as a significant predictor of participants' perceptions of the trustworthiness of the scientist. Rather, only the scientist's stated values significantly predicted how trustworthy participants rated the scientist such that a scientist who disclosed valuing public health was rated as more trustworthy than a scientist who disclosed valuing economic growth. This was true even for participants who valued economic growth over public health.

## Variation in Effect Sizes ## 

We ran the following analyses to test our hypothesis that (H5) the magnitude of the effects found for the tests of H2-H4 vary depending on whether the participant prioritizes public health or economic growth. Results are presented in Table #.

H5a - consumer risk sensitivity
To test whether the findings regarding consumer risk sensitivity vary as a function of participants' values, we regressed participants' METI ratings of the scientist in the stimuli onto the Conclusions condition, Participants' Values variable, and the Conclusions by Participants' values interaction term. The full model was significant, adj. R^2 = .173, F(3, 840) = 59.95, p < .001. As with the earlier analysis, results showed a main effect of the Conclusions condition, such that participants rated the scientist who reported that BPA causes harm as more trustworthy than the scientist who reported that BPA does not cause harm. However, this effect was qualified by a significant interaction with participants' values. Participants who prioritized public health over economic growth and read about a scientist who concluded that BPA causes harm rated the scientist as more trustworthy than participants who read about a scientist who concluded that BPA does not cause harm, regardless of those participants' values.


H5b - transparency penalty
To test whether the findings above about a hypothesized transparency penalty may vary based on participants' values, we regressed participants' METI ratings of the scientist onto the Disclosure condition variable, Participants' Values variable, and the Disclosure by Participants' Values interaction term. The full model was not significant, adj. R^2 < .001, F(3, 840) = 1.19, p = .31. As with the earlier analysis, our results do not provide evidence for a transparency penalty to the perceived trustworthiness of a scientist, either in general or interacting with participants' own reported values. 


H5c - shared values
To test whether the findings regarding Shared values vary as a function of participants' values, we regressed participants' METI ratings of the scientist in the stimuli onto the Shared Values variable, Participants' Values variable, and the Shared Values by Participants' values interaction term. The full model was significant, adj. R^2 = .065, F(3, 563) = 14.15, p < .001. Results from this analysis suggests that Shared Values does predict the perceived trustworthiness of a scientist, such that if participants share the same values as the scientist, the scientist is perceived as more trustworthy. The model revealed a significant interaction between Shared Values and Participants' Values such that the highest perceived trustworthiness ratings were from participants who prioritized public health over economic growth reading about a scientist who disclosed valuing public health. However, as revealed in our analysis for H4, the evidence that shared values between the participant and scientist are what predicts the perceived trustworthiness of a scientist should be interpreted with caution. Because of the inclusion of Participants' values and the Scientist's values in the analysis for H4, the set of predictor variables for that model and the set of predictor variables for this model are different linear combinations of each other. Hence why the resulting full model parameters are identical between the two models. In spite of this, we report the results of this analysis for the sake of completeness, as this was an a priori planned statistical analysis.

Because of the findings from the analysis run to test H4, we conducted an unplanned post hoc analysis to further test the hypothesis that the effects found in the earlier analysis vary as a function of participants' values. For this test, we regression METI scores onto the Scientist's Values experimental condition, the Shared Values composite variable, and their interaction term. This is, as with the previous model and the model reported to test H4, a different linear combination of the same predictor variables and therefore the full model parameters are identical. However, presentation of the model this way renders a clearer picture of what variables we tested seem to be driving perceptions of the trustworthiness of a scientist. The evidence here suggests that if a scientist chooses to disclose their values alongside their presentation of scientific research, what values they share predicts their perceived trustworthiness, and that the scientist in our study who disclosed valuing public health was perceived a significantly more trustworthy than the scientist who disclosed valuing economic growth.
