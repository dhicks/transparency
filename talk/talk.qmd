## Background & acknowledgment

- I'm a philosopher of science, STSer, data scientist
    - Science, values, and policy
    - Public scientific controversies
- Emilio is a cognitive psychologist
    - Conspiracy theories & other \
      "epistemically unwarranted beliefs"

# Controversy and public understanding of science # {center="true"}

## Explaining public scientific controversies {.smaller}

HPSTSers often explain controversies by appeal to public views on\ 
science, values, and policy issues

<!-- - "The scientific method" [@MercerWhyPopperCan2016; @JohnEpistemicTrustEthics2017] -->
- Objectivity & value-free ideal [VFI] [@FernandezPintoLegitimizingValuesRegulatory2019; @KovakaClimateChangeDenial2021]
- Consensus and dissent [@OreskesScientificConsensusClimate2004; @CookQuantifyingConsensusAnthropogenic2013; @JohnEpistemicTrustEthics2017; @MyersConsensusRevisitedQuantifying2021]
- Paternalism/technocracy/elitism \
    [@WynneSheepfarmingChernobylCase1989; @JordanTrustworthinessResearchParadigm2011; @LargentVaccineDebateModern2012; @NavinValuesVaccineRefusal2015; @GoldenbergVaccineHesitancyPublic2021]
- Conflicts of interest, manufacturing doubt or certainty \
    [@ElliottSciencePolicyTransparency2014; @FernandezPintoCommercialInterestsErosion2020; @GoldenbergVaccineHesitancyPublic2021]
- Science's historical and/or contemporary role in oppression \
    [@SchemanEpistemologyResuscitatedObjectivity2001; @WashingtonMedicalApartheidDark2008; @McHughMoreSkinDeep2011; @NelsonBodySoulBlack2011; @GrasswickUnderstandingEpistemicTrust2018;  @GoldenbergVaccineHesitancyPublic2021]

## But do the public hold these views? 

(As a gross generalization)

- Historians focus on actions of scientists or merchants of doubt
- Sociologists look at very particular case studies that don't generalize to public at large
- Philosophers don't offer any empirical evidence

## Two notable exceptions {style="font-size:80%"}

- <normsize>@WeisbergKnowledgeNatureScience2020</normsize>
    - Evolution/creationism, climate, vaccines
    - Using a "Nature of Science" instrument
      [@LombrozoImportanceUnderstandingNature2008]
    - But don't include any items from the science, values, and policy literature [[Table 1](https://journals.sagepub.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/sage/journals/content/pusa/2021/pusa_30_2/0963662520977700/20210201/images/large/10.1177_0963662520977700-table1.jpeg){target="_blank"}]
        
- <normsize>@ElliottValuesEnvironmentalResearch2017</normsize>
    - Does transparency about values in science reduce trust? 
    - Online survey experiment
    - But don't ask about participants' views on, eg, VFI

## Data and methods ##

- Online survey platform Prolific
- Representative sample of 980 US adults
- VISS + demographics + replication of <normsize>@ElliottValuesEnvironmentalResearch2017</normsize>
- Approved by UC Merced IRB

</br>

- [Exploratory factor analysis](#factor-analysis-results) of VISS items
- [Regression analysis](#replication-of-elliottvaluesenvironmentalresearch2017) of major findings from <normsize>@ElliottValuesEnvironmentalResearch2017</normsize>

## Agreement/disagreement: </br> All VISS items ##

```{r, fig.height=5.75}
library(plotly)
library(here)

barplotly = read_rds(here('out', '02_div_barplot.Rds'))
barplotly
```

## Agreement/disagreement: </br>Top & bottom 5 ##

                        cells_body(rows = group == 'bottom 5'))
```

## Ambiguous prompts {style="font-size:70%"}

ir.1
: Standards of scientific evidence are different in different situations.

</br>
Does this mean

- *<blue>legitimate</blue>* standards of evidence can be *<blue>appropriately</blue>* different in different situations (eg, because of different downstream non-epistemic consequences); **or**
- scientists *<red>illegitimately</red>* use different standards of evidence in different situations (eg, to reach their preferred conclusion)? 

</br>

- Measurement error:  \
    How many participants understood the prompt one way vs. the other? 
- Construct validity:  \
    Does the item measure the thing you intended to measure? 
- Requires understanding how participants interpret prompts

## Elliott et al. major findings

Transparency penalty
: If the scientist discloses values, participants tend to perceive them as less trustworthy

Shared values effect
: If the participant and scientist share the same values, participants tend to perceive the scientist as more trustworthy



## Transparency penalty? 

![](../out/04_transparency.png){fig-alt="Dotplot of trust ratings for Elliott et al. (2017) and our data, broken out by whether or not the scientist disclosed values.  Elliott et al. found an estimated effect of transparency of about -0.5 on a 1-7 scale; our data shows a negligible difference."}

## Shared values effect? 

![](../out/04_shared_part.png){fig-alt="Dotplot of trust ratings for our data, broken out by participant values (economic growth or public health) and whether they share disclosed values with the scientist.  The effect of shared values appears to be positive or negative depending on the participants' values."}

## Scientist values effect

![](../out/04_sci_part.png){fig-alt="Dotplot of trust ratings for our data, broken out by participant values (economic growth or public health) and the scientists' disclosed values.  Scientist valuing public health appears to increase trust, about 0.7 on a 1-7 scale, for both public health and economic growth participants."}




# Future work #

## Future work {}

- Qualitative designs to revise prompts
    - Paraphrase the prompt; think aloud
    - Likely will reduce measurement error
- Other endpoints
    - Dueling expert scenarios
    - Trust in science-policy institutions (EPA) rather than individual scientists [@BrownTrustExpertiseScientific2022\; Biddle yesterday]
    - Policy support

: Someone's moral and social values are more like their taste in music than scientific facts.

fallible-1
: Once a scientific theory has been established, it is never changed.^K^

fallible-2
: When a scientific theory changes or is revised, it means that the research that went into it initially was flawed.

pluralism-3
: All scientists use the same strict requirements for determining when empirical data confirm a tested hypothesis.

scientism-1
: Science is more reliable than any other way of producing knowledge.

scientism-2
: Everyone, whatever their worldview, should accept evidence-based scientific conclusions

scientism-3
: Science is the only source of justified belief or knowledge about ourselves and the world.

stdpt-1
: A scientific understanding of the social word depends on the background of the scientists carrying out the research.

stdpt-2
: People on the margins of society often have a unique understanding of that society that can benefit scientific research. 

stdpt-3
: Science has a long history of ignoring the unique insights of women and people of color.

technocracy-1
: Public policy should wait until all relevant scientific questions have been settled.

technocracy-2
: When it comes to public policy, scientific evidence is more important than public opinion. 

technocrac-3
: Scientists have too much influence over public policy today. 

vfi-1
: Scientists are more objective than other people.^K^

vfi-2
: Scientists do not use imagination or creativity because doing so interferes with objectivity.^K^

vfi-3
: The evaluation and acceptance of scientific results must not be influenced by social and ethical values.^K^
