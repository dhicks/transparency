    The present regulation of carcinogens is quite slow; hundreds of substances
    that have tested positive for carcinogenicity in animal bioassays have not
    been addressed by the U.S. regulatory system. This carries with it
    unappreciated social, economic, and public health costs. However, there are
    readily available expedited approximation procedures for assessing the
    potency of carcinogens whose use has substantial benefits that outweigh any
    costs from less science-intensive and less extensively documented
    assessments. These benefits can be seen by using a model to suggest the
    magnitude of social costs in regulating carcinogens by current conventional
    methods compared with expedited procedures for assessing the potency of
    known carcinogens. Two scenarios, one in accordance with current agency
    presumptions and one which assumes extreme unreliability in animal data and
    in the accuracy of potency assessments, compare conventional
    science-intensive and expedited procedures. On both, the total social costs
    of expedited procedures are lower than conventional procedures across a wide
    range of values assigned for individual mistakes of under regulation and
    over regulation. It appears better to evaluate a larger universe of known
    carcinogens somewhat less intensively for each substance than to evaluate a
    small proportion of that same universe very carefully and delay considering
    the rest.

    The role of values in scientific research has become an important topic of
    discussion in both scholarly and popular debates. Pundits across the
    political spectrum worry that research on topics like climate change,
    evolutionary theory, vaccine safety, and genetically modified foods has
    become overly politicized. At the same time, it is clear that values play an
    important role in science by limiting unethical forms of research and by
    deciding what areas of research have the greatest relevance for society.
    Deciding how to distinguish legitimate and illegitimate influences of values
    in scientific research is a matter of vital importance. Recently,
    philosophers of science have written a great deal on this topic, but most of
    their work has been directed toward a scholarly audience. This book makes
    the contemporary philosophical literature on science and values accessible
    to a wide readership. It examines case studies from a variety of research
    areas, including climate science, anthropology, chemical risk assessment,
    ecology, neurobiology, biomedical research, and agriculture. These cases
    show that values have necessary roles to play in identifying research
    topics, choosing research questions, determining the aims of inquiry,
    responding to uncertainty, and deciding how to communicate information.
    Kevin Elliott focuses not just on describing roles for values but also on
    determining when their influences are actually appropriate. He emphasizes
    several conditions for incorporating values in a legitimate fashion, and
    highlights multiple strategies for fostering engagement between stakeholders
    so that value influences can be subjected to careful and critical scrutiny.

  abstract: >-
    Scientists who perform environmental research on policy-relevant topics face
    challenges when communicating about how values may have influenced their
    research. This study examines how citizens view scientists who publicly
    acknowledge values. Specifically, we investigate whether it matters: if
    citizens share or oppose a scientist’s values, if a scientist’s conclusions
    seem contrary to or consistent with the scientist’s values, and if a
    scientist is assessing the state of the science or making a policy
    recommendation. We conducted two 3x2 factorial design online experiments.
    Experiment 1 featured a hypothetical scientist assessing the state of the
    science on the public-health effects of exposure to Bisphenol A (BPA), and
    Experiment 2 featured a scientist making a policy recommendation on use of
    BPA. We manipulated whether or not the scientist expressed values and
    whether the scientist’s conclusion appeared contrary to or consistent with
    the scientist’s values, and we accounted for whether or not subjects’ values
    aligned with the scientist’s values. We analyzed our data with ordinary
    least squares (OLS) regression techniques. Our results provide at least
    preliminary evidence that acknowledging values may reduce the perceived
    credibility of scientists within the general public, but this effect differs
    depending on whether scientists and citizens share values, whether
    scientists draw conclusions that run contrary to their values, and whether
    scientists make policy recommendations.

  abstract: >-
    Background:Over the last several decades, scientists and social groups have
    frequently raised concerns about politicization or political interference in
    regulatory science. Public actors (environmentalists and industry advocates,
    politically aligned public figures, scientists and political commentators,
    in the United States as well as in other countries) across major
    political-regulatory controversies have expressed concerns about the
    inappropriate politicization of science. Although we share concerns about
    the politicization of science, they are frequently framed in terms of an
    ideal of value-free science, according to which political and economic
    values have no legitimate role to play in science. For several decades, work
    in philosophy of science has identified serious conceptual and practical
    problems with the value-free ideal.Objectives:Our objectives are to discuss
    the literature regarding the conceptual and practical problems with the
    value-free ideal and offer a constructive alternative to the value-free
    ideal.Discussion:We first discuss the prevalence of the value-free ideal in
    regulatory science, then argue that this ideal is self-undermining and has
    been exploited to delay protective regulation. To offer a constructive
    alternative, we analyze the relationship between the goals of regulatory
    science and the standards of good scientific activity. This analysis raises
    questions about the relationship between methodological and practical
    standards for good science, tensions among various important social goods,
    and tensions among various social interests. We argue that the aims of
    regulatory science help to legitimize value-laden choices regarding research
    methods and study designs. Finally, we discuss how public deliberation,
    adaptive management, and community-based participatory research can be used
    to improve the legitimacy of scientists as representatives of the general
    public on issues of environmental knowledge.Conclusions:Reflecting on the
    aims of regulatory science—such as protecting human health and the
    environment, informing democratic deliberation, and promoting the capacities
    of environmental justice and Indigenous communities—can clarify when values
    have legitimate roles in regulatory science.

    This study explores time trends in public trust in science in the United
    States from 1974 to 2010. More precisely, I test Mooney’s (2005) claim that
    conservatives in the United States have become increasingly distrustful of
    science. Using data from the 1974 to 2010 General Social Survey, I examine
    group differences in trust in science and group-specific change in these
    attitudes over time. Results show that group differences in trust in science
    are largely stable over the period, except for respondents identifying as
    conservative. Conservatives began the period with the highest trust in
    science, relative to liberals and moderates, and ended the period with the
    lowest. The patterns for science are also unique when compared to public
    trust in other secular institutions. Results show enduring differences in
    trust in science by social class, ethnicity, gender, church attendance, and
    region. I explore the implications of these findings, specifically, the
    potential for political divisions to emerge over the cultural authority of
    science and the social role of experts in the formation of public policy.

    The public has voiced concern over the adverse effects of vaccines from the
    moment Dr. Edward Jenner introduced the first smallpox vaccine in 1796. The
    controversy over childhood immunization intensified in 1998, when Dr. Andrew
    Wakefield linked the MMR vaccine to autism. Although Wakefield’s findings
    were later discredited and retracted, and medical and scientific evidence
    suggests routine immunizations have significantly reduced life-threatening
    conditions like measles, whooping cough, and polio, vaccine refusal and
    vaccine-preventable outbreaks are on the rise. This book explores vaccine
    hesitancy and refusal among parents in the industrialized North. Although
    biomedical, public health, and popular science literature has focused on a
    scientifically ignorant public, the real problem, Maya J. Goldenberg argues,
    lies not in misunderstanding, but in mistrust. Public confidence in
    scientific institutions and government bodies has been shaken by fraud,
    research scandals, and misconduct. Her book reveals how vaccine studies
    sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry, compelling rhetorics from the
    anti-vaccine movement, and the spread of populist knowledge on social media
    have all contributed to a public mistrust of the scientific consensus.
    Importantly, it also emphasizes how historical and current discrimination in
    health care against marginalized communities continues to shape public
    perception of institutional trustworthiness. Goldenberg ultimately reframes
    vaccine hesitancy as a crisis of public trust rather than a war on science,
    arguing that having good scientific support of vaccine efficacy and safety
    is not enough. In a fraught communications landscape, Vaccine Hesitancy
    advocates for trust-building measures that focus on relationships,
    transparency, and justice.

    Given their lack of background knowledge, laypeople require expert help when
    dealing with scientific information. To decide whose help is dependable,
    laypeople must judge an expert’s epistemic trustworthiness in terms of
    competence, adherence to scientific standards, and good intentions. Online,
    this may be difficult due to the often limited and sometimes unreliable
    source information available. To measure laypeople’s evaluations of experts
    (encountered online), we constructed an inventory to assess epistemic
    trustworthiness on the dimensions expertise, integrity, and benevolence.
    Exploratory (n = 237) and confirmatory factor analyses (n = 345) showed that
    the Muenster Epistemic Trustworthiness Inventory (METI) is composed of these
    three factors. A subsequent experimental study (n = 137) showed that all
    three dimensions of the METI are sensitive to variation in source
    characteristics. We propose using this inventory to measure assignments of
    epistemic trustworthiness, that is, all judgments laypeople make when
    deciding whether to place epistemic trust in–and defer to–an expert in order
    to solve a scientific informational problem that is beyond their
    understanding.

  abstract: >-
    The 2016 presidential election was a jarring event for polling in the United
    States. Preelection polls fueled high-profile predictions that Hillary
    Clinton’s likelihood of winning the presidency was about 90 percent, with
    estimates ranging from 71 to over 99 percent. When Donald Trump was declared
    the winner of the presidency, there was a widespread perception that the
    polls failed. But did the polls fail? And if so, why? Those are among the
    central questions addressed by an American Association for Public Opinion
    Research (AAPOR) ad hoc committee. This paper presents the committee’s
    analysis of the performance of preelection polls in 2016, how that
    performance compares to polling in prior elections, and the extent to which
    performance varied by poll design. In addition, the committee examined
    several theories as to why many polls, particularly in the Upper Midwest,
    underestimated support for Trump. The explanations for which the most
    evidence exists are a late swing in vote preference toward Trump and a
    pervasive failure to adjust for overrepresentation of college graduates (who
    favored Clinton). In addition, there is clear evidence that voter turnout
    changed from 2012 to 2016 in ways that favored Trump, though there is only
    mixed evidence that misspecified likely voter models were a major cause of
    the systematic polling error. Finally, there is little evidence that
    socially desirable (Shy Trump) responding was an important contributor to
    poll error.

  abstract: >-
    Social scientists have offered a number of explanations for why Americans
    commonly deny that human-caused climate change is real. In this paper, I
    argue that these explanations neglect an important group of climate change
    deniers: those who say they are on the side of science while also rejecting
    what they know most climate scientists accept. I then develop a “nature of
    science” hypothesis that does account for this group of deniers. According
    to this hypothesis, people have serious misconceptions about what scientific
    inquiry ought to look like. Their misconceptions interact with partisan
    biases to produce denial of human-caused climate change. After I develop
    this hypothesis, I propose ways of confirming that it is true. Then I
    consider its implications for efforts to combat climate change denial and
    for other cases of public rejection of science.

    Research has documented the decline of trust in science among Republicans,
    ideological conservatives, and fundamentalist religious groups. However,
    less is known about the nature of party polarization in these trends: did
    polarization only increase because of changes among Republicans? In this
    study, the author tests a two-sided polarization thesis using data from the
    General Social Survey (1974–2018). The findings show that a significant
    share of the growth in party polarization is due to an increase of trust in
    science among Democrats. In fact, by the 2010s, Democrats became
    significantly more likely than either Republicans or independents to have
    high confidence in science. Moreover, the results also show that the
    aggregate party-level changes are driven largely by trends among
    conservative Republicans, moderate Democrats, and liberal Democrats.
    Together, these findings have implications for our understanding of the
    nature and potential causes of partisan polarization in beliefs about the
    cultural authority of science.

  abstract: >-
    When communicating scientific information, experts often face difficult
    choices about how to promote public understanding while also maintaining an
    appropriate level of objectivity. We argue that one way for scientists and
    others involved in communicating scientific information to alleviate these
    tensions is to pay closer attention to the major frames employed in the
    contexts in which they work. By doing so, they can ideally employ useful
    frames while also enabling the recipients of information to “backtrack” to
    relatively uncontroversial facts and recognize how these frames relate to
    their own values and perspectives. Important strategies for promoting this
    sort of backtracking include identifying the weaknesses of particular
    frames, preventing misunderstanding of them, differentiating well-supported
    findings from more speculative claims, and acknowledging major alternative
    frames.

    We examine key aspects of data quality for online behavioral research
    between selected platforms (Amazon Mechanical Turk, CloudResearch, and
    Prolific) and panels (Qualtrics and Dynata). To identify the key aspects of
    data quality, we first engaged with the behavioral research community to
    discover which aspects are most critical to researchers and found that these
    include attention, comprehension, honesty, and reliability. We then explored
    differences in these data quality aspects in two studies (N ~ 4000), with or
    without data quality filters (approval ratings). We found considerable
    differences between the sites, especially in comprehension, attention, and
    dishonesty. In Study 1 (without filters), we found that only Prolific
    provided high data quality on all measures. In Study 2 (with filters), we
    found high data quality among CloudResearch and Prolific. MTurk showed
    alarmingly low data quality even with data quality filters. We also found
    that while reputation (approval rating) did not predict data quality,
    frequency and purpose of usage did, especially on MTurk: the lowest data
    quality came from MTurk participants who report using the site as their main
    source of income but spend few hours on it per week. We provide a framework
    for future investigation into the ever-changing nature of data quality in
    online research, and how the evolving set of platforms and panels performs
    on these key aspects.
