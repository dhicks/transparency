# Controversy and mismatch # {center="true"}

## Mismatch hypothesis

- A mismatch between **public understanding of philosophy of science** and **realities of scientific practice**
- This mismatch contributes to public scientific controversies
- In some cases, this mismatch has been deliberately exploited to manufacture doubt

## John: Climategate vs. transparency

*[E]pistemic trust in science may be 'fragile' because based on a false 'folk philosophy of science'.* [@JohnEpistemicTrustEthics2017 6-7]

::::

- Inferring causation from correlation (observational data)
- Refusing (desk rejecting) papers by climate skeptics
- "[I]gnoring recalcitrant or strange data sets" [@JohnEpistemicTrustEthics2017 7]

*[P]eople have serious misconceptions about what scientific inquiry ought to look like. Their misconceptions interact with partisan biases to produce denial of human-caused climate change.* [@KovakaClimateChangeDenial2021 1]

Misconceptions about 

- Objectivity: "scientists as more objective than other people"; value-free ideal
- Scientific method: "a universal, step-by-step scientific method," based on experiments
- Uncertainty and fallibility: Galileo narratives and quest for certainty [@KovakaClimateChangeDenial2021 11-14]


## Nature of science

*[substantial area of research, esp. by education researchers; 
but no scale we found considered role of values in a sophisticated way]

"more than 25 NOS instruments have been developed over the past 50 years" [Neumann citing Lederman 2007]
LiangStudentUnderstandingScience2006 -> Lombrozo et al -> Weisberg et al.
Lombrozo et al version critiqued by Neumann
    - N had science educators map L items to categories based on a lit review of NOS education research (1377, 1384); these don't correspond to L's phil sci-informed categories (1384ff), and don't include issues such as VFI
    - psychometric critique

## *[other empirical research]*

*[Elliott et al; Safford et al]



# Developing a Values in Science Scale (VISS)

- Statistical analysis of several findings from *[elliott et al]*
