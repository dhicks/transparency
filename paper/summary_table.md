: Summary of replication results.  95% confidence intervals. $^\star$The shared values $\times$ participant values interaction specification had perfect multicollinearity and could not be fit.  $^\dagger$For these unplanned analyses, "yes" indicates that we found evidence supporting the stated hypothesis, and "no" indicates that we did not find such evidence. $^\ddagger$Our analysis method found no evidence of a shared values effect in the @ElliottValuesEnvironmentalResearch2017 data. {#tbl-summary}
