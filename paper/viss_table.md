aims-1           Aims of science           The knowledge produced by scientific research 
                                           is valuable even when it has no practical 
                                           applications. 
                                           
aims-2           Aims of science           A primary aim of science is to improve our 
                                           understanding of threats to human health and 
                                           the environment.

aims-3           Aims of science           A primary aim of science is to develop new 
                                           technology and stimulate economic growth.

coi-1            Conflicts of interest     Scientists will report conclusions that they 
                                           think will get them more grant money even if 
                                           the data does not fully support that conclusion.

coi-2            Conflicts of interest     Special interests can always find an 
                                           scientist-for-hire who will support their 
                                           point of view.

coi-3            Conflicts of interest     Research carried out by private companies is 
                                           less trustworthy than research carried out by 
                                           public instutitions.

consensus-1      Consensus                 Progress in science happens when a lone 
                                           dissenter challenges popular ideas. 

consensus-2      Consensus                 Scientists rarely disagree with each other 
                                           about the answers to scientific questions.

consensus-3      Consensus                 The consensus of the scientific community is 
                                           based on social status and prestige rather than 
                                           evidence. 

factvalue-1      Facts vs. values          Moral and social values are the kinds of things 
                                           that can be confirmed or challenged by 
                                           scientific evidence. 

factvalue-2      Facts vs. values          If scientific findings conflict with important 
                                           values that we hold, it's appropriate to be 
                                           skeptical of the science.

factvalue-3      Facts vs. values          Someone's moral and social values are more 
                                           like their taste in music than scientific 
                                           facts.

fallible-1       Fallibilism               Once a scientific theory has been established, 
                                           it is never changed.

fallible-2       Fallibilism               When a scientific theory changes or is revised, 
                                           it means that the research that went into it 
                                           initially was flawed.

fallible-3       Fallibilism               Scientific findings can be good enough to act 
                                           on even when they're not entirely certain. 

ir-1             Inductive risk            Standards of scientific evidence are different 
                                           in different situations.

ir-2             Inductive risk            Scientists are not responsible for harmful 
                                           effects of the technologies they develop.

ir-3             Inductive risk            When scientific research has potential 
                                           consequences for society, scientists must take 
                                           these consequences into account when drawing 
                                           conclusions.

nonsubj-1        Non-subjectivity          The results of scientific studies are always 
                                           ambiguous and require interpretation.

nonsubj-2        Non-subjectivity          Good scientific research is always free of 
                                           assumptions and speculation.

nonsubj-3        Non-subjectivity          Scientific conclusions are never a matter of 
                                           interpretation or judgment.

pluralism-1      Pluralism                 Scientific investigations always require 
                                           laboratory experiments.

pluralism-2      Pluralism                 Scientific research is always conducted in the 
                                           following order: 1. Observation, 2. Hypothesis, 
                                           3. Experiment, 4. Conclusion

pluralism-3      Pluralism                 All scientists use the same strict requirements 
                                           for determining when empirical data confirm a 
                                           tested hypothesis.

scientism-1      Scientism                 Science is more reliable than any other way of 
                                           producing knowledge.

scientism-2      Scientism                 Everyone, whatever their worldview, should 
                                           accept evidence-based scientific conclusions. 

scientism-3      Scientism                 Science is the only source of justified belief 
                                           or knowledge about ourselves and the world.

stdpt-1          Standpoint                A scientific understanding of the social word 
                                           depends on the background of the scientists 
                                           carrying out the research.

stdpt-2          Standpoint                People on the margins of society often have a 
                                           unique understanding of that society that can 
                                           benefit scientific research. 

stdpt-3          Standpoint                Science has a long history of ignoring the 
                                           unique insights of women and people of color.

technocracy-1    Technocracy               Public policy should wait until all relevant 
                                           scientific questions have been settled.

technocracy-2    Technocracy               When it comes to public policy, scientific 
                                           evidence is more important than public opinion. 

technocracy-3    Technocracy               Scientists have too much influence over public 
                                           policy today. 

vfi-1            Value-free ideal          Scientists are more objective than other people.

vfi-2            Value-free ideal          Scientists do not use imagination or creativity 
                                           because doing so interferes with objectivity. 

vfi-3            Value-free ideal          The evaluation and acceptance of scientific 
                                           results must not be influenced by social and 
                                           ethical values.
